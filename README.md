## What is Crescent?

Crescent is a FOSS client for the [Revolt](https://revolt.chat/?utm_source=github) protocol, that
aims to provide a streamlined chatting experience for both new and returning users by taking heavy
inspiration from other chatting applications such as [Signal](https://signal.org),
[WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com) and [Telegram](https://telegram.org).

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to simplify chatting on Revolt, by omitting Server support and
focusing on direct messages and group chats, whilst also being snappy and lightweight.

Other goals include:

- Closely following Material design principles
- Supporting other Revolt instances
- Learn Kotlin, Jetpack and Android libraries and concepts

## Why Crescent?

Crescent started as a port of the small hobby project called
[RevoltMini](https://amycatgirl.codeberg.org/revoltmini). As the name suggests, the client aimed to
be a small and lightweight web app for revolt, as low-end devices can struggle loading the official
web client, but ended up being discontinued after the codebase became a huge, unmaintainable mess.

After ending development, I wanted to give android app development a try. And what a better way to
learn native development than to make a chat client using websockets. Hence, Crescent.

## Logo and Name

### Name meaning

The name "Crescent" was chosen after a poll was held in Mastodon, with "Croissant" being another
possible option. The logo also looks like a moon crescent.

### Logo Meaning

As @lo2dev pointed out in a reply to a development screenshot showcasing the logo in-launcher:

> I was thinking it represents a moon and it's parent planet, with the moon being your client,
> and the planet (being) revolt as a whole. Your client is the moon because it's small in scope.
>
> [Context (Requires having a revolt.chat account and joining the Catgirl Dungeon server)](https://app.revolt.chat/server/01F80118K1F2EYD9XAMCPQ0BCT/channel/01F8ZK42Q4W4RF4RREVRD90E3J/01HTTAS71C0HR22Z02AHXEJ3XT)
